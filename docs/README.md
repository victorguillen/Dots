## Connect Dots

### Background

Gameplay of Dots: users connect lines of dots to eliminate all dots in that line, or close a line to remove all dots of that color from the screen. The purpose of the game is to get the highest score possible of connected dots, after dots are connected they disappear and new dots fall from the top to replace the missing dots.

There's a score count of how may dots have been connected and a timer counting down to zero. When the timer hits zero the game is over and a play again button appears on screen to play a new game.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Canvas with HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all modules, learn the basics of Canvas.

**Day 2**: Dedicate this day to learning the Canvas Goals: Render dots and background.

**Day 3**: Create the game logic: gameplay, timer, score count.

**Day 4**: Install the controls for the user to interact with the game. Style the front end, making it polished and professional.
